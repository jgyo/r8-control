# R8 Control

**R8 Control** (R8C) is an external Run 8 controller offering precise throttle
control and many other features. It is designed for use on multiple-screen
systems where Run 8 is viewed in full-screen mode, and **R8C** is viewed
on another. However, it is possible to view Run 8 in window mode
and have both programs operating on a single screen.

Run 8 already supports Rail Driver and has a keyboard and
mouse interface. Why should you consider using **R8C** with Run 8?
There are several reasons. First and foremost, Rail Driver
and keyboard inputs are imprecise, making fine control of
the train throttle and brakes difficult. **R8C**, on the other hand,
allows precise increments and decrements of the throttle and
brake controls, making it much easier to find "sweet spots" where
everything balances out and trains run themselves.

There are many places where that may be impossible, even with fine
control, like locations where the grade changes frequently, but even
there, the ability to subtlely adjust your inputs helps.

And keyboard shortcuts can be complex to remember, especially where
many of them exist. You will still use some shortcuts
while using **R8C**, but less often. **R8C** has buttons
and sliders for all of the following functions (plus some):

* The throttle.
* Dynamic brakes.
* Air brakes (aka train brakes).
* The independent (Indy) brakes.
* The reverser.
* The parking brakes.
* The horn.
* The bell.
* Alert recognition.
* Slow speed start and stop.
* Set and release the parking brakes.
* The sander.
* EOT Emergency Stop.
* All of the auto start/configuration options.
* All of the manual start/configuration options (for realism).
* DPU controls.
* Traction Motors.
* Radio controls.
* Light controls.

You might also appreciate seeing not only the previous signal's
type but also the next signal's type. That's not available even
in Run 8 by itself.

And, in addition to these and other features you will find in
**R8C**, the program is free and open source. When I tire of
updating the code to keep up with Run 8 and add new features,
another developer may come along with his own branch, and pick
up where I've stopped.

So, download a copy for yourself, and enjoy!
