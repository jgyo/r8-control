New: Two ways to install R8 Control. You can continue to install
from a zip file, or you can choose to run a setup executable.
The setup executable will create an uninstall file that
can be used to uninstall the application. Use Add or Remove Programs
in the Control Panel to uninstall, if you use the setup
executable to install.
